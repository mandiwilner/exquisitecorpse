  <h1>Story Title</h1>
  <h2>Authors here</h2>
  <p>Once upon a time on a hot summer day there was a young girl named Amanda floating in her swimming pool eating a Reese's peanut butter cup. Life seemed great. Life was simple. She was a freshman in highschool, had all the friends she wanted and was her junior varsity cheerleading captain. On this specific Friday after school she was relaxing and waiting for her best friend to come over. That night was a big night, her parents were on a one night trip and she and her older brother who was a senior had the chance to finally throw a party.</p>
  <br>
  <p> But, her brother hated parties. He was kind of a nerd and only liked playing video games with his friends at night. Amanda thought it was smart to play a prank on her older brother. Say he could bring all his friends over and throw a party so that he couldn't get out of it. She wanted him to have a good time and wanted him to be popular like her. Also, she wanted his hot friend Trevor to come to the party and see her in her natural habitat. She called her friend Lindsey to talk about the party.</p>

   <br>
  <p>Lindsey said she would make sure Amanda's brother and his friends have fun. She said she would invite her cousin, Josh, since he is always the life of the party and easy to talk to. Nine o'clock eventually rolls around, and Amanda's brother and his friends were all in the basement playing videogames. Other people started to show up to the house, and Josh arrived with a backpack on his shoulder. Walking up the steps, he greeted Amanda and Lindsey with a hug. He walked inside and through the crowded halls to the kitchen to set his backback down on the counter. Amanda watched him as he unzipped his backpack; his eyebrows were burrowed and his eyes seemed numb. He dug through his back pack for a while before he began to finally pull his hand back out.</p>
