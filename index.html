  <h1>A PARTY OUT OF THIS WORLD</h1>
  <h2>Written by Claire, Mandi, Reese and Summer</h2>
  <div class="scroll">
    <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once upon a time on a hot summer day there was a young girl named Amanda floating in her swimming pool eating a Reese's peanut butter cup. Life seemed great. Life was simple. She was a freshman in highschool, had all the friends she wanted and was her junior varsity cheerleading captain. On this specific Friday after school she was relaxing and waiting for her best friend to come over. That night was a big night, her parents were on a one night trip and she and her older brother who was a senior had the chance to finally throw a party.</p>
    <br>
    <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, her brother hated parties. He was kind of a nerd and only liked playing video games with his friends at night. Amanda thought it was smart to play a prank on her older brother. Say he could bring all his friends over and throw a party so that he couldn't get out of it. She wanted him to have a good time and wanted him to be popular like her. Also, she wanted his hot friend Trevor to come to the party and see her in her natural habitat. She called her friend Lindsey to talk about the party.</p>
    <br>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lindsey said she would make sure Amanda's brother and his friends have fun. She said she would invite her cousin, Josh, since he is always the life of the party and easy to talk to. Nine o'clock eventually rolls around, and Amanda's brother and his friends were all in the basement playing videogames. Other people started to show up to the house, and Josh arrived with a backpack on his shoulder. Walking up the steps, he greeted Amanda and Lindsey with a hug. He walked inside and through the crowded halls to the kitchen to set his backback down on the counter. Amanda watched him as he unzipped his backpack; his eyebrows were burrowed and his eyes seemed numb. He dug through his back pack for a while before he began to finally pull his hand back out.</p>
    <br>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was a bag of pills. Amanda looked at Lindsey confused, looking for a sign of confusion in her face as well. But she didnt seem to care, she just walked right up to her cousin and handed him a drink. Amanda sat watching as the entire party, including Lindsey, took part of Josh's party favor but she refused. She walked upstairs to her room because she was upset that her party turned into this and just wanted to relax. Twenty minutes passed and no one seemed to notice or care that she was gone, they were all in their own worlds. Just as she was getting ready for bed she remembered her brother and his friends were in the basement. Amanda walked downstairs to join them in hopes for getting some normal human interaction. Just as she walked down the basement stairs and greeted them all they heard a blood curdling scream. </p>
    <br>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amanda, her brother, and his friends all looked at eachother with a look of fear in their eyes. They ran upstairs to find the house completely empty. Not a single noise. They looked outside and still couldn't find anyone. The look in their eyes quickly turned from fear to confusion. Empty cups and the other evidence of their party were scattered around the house ... just no people. However, Josh's backpack filled with bags of pills was sitting on the couch. In the far distance, Amanda started to hear police sirens.</p>
    <br>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, where did everyone go. Just as they were starting to talk about it, the police tapped on the door. Amanda shouted that she was coming but the police entered calling out if anyone was home. "Yeah we are home what is going on, we didn't let you in," Trevor said to the cop, but the cop just walked right through him not seeing him at all. Amanda gasped and looked at her brother. They all tried to talk to the cops but it seemed they were hollow. Lindsey's eyes went huge. 
    <br><br>
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What the hell do we do?", "What happened? What are we?" Questions were pouring from each of their mouths. The cops looked around with flashlights commenting on how it looked like the party just disappeared into thin air. </p>
    <br>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The police started rummaging through the scattered bottles and cups, eventually coming across the pill bottle. A cop picked it up to examine it, but the bottle was empty. "What are those?" Amanda asked the cop. 
    <br><br> The cop didn't seem to hear her, "It says, 'X-X872... take once by mouth once a week,'" the cop said to the other cops, "What the hell is this?" he said. Lindsey's face went white, her eyes blank. 
    <br><br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What is it, Lindsey?" Amanda asked her. She didn't answer, "Lindsey, what are those pills?"
    <br><br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lindsey took a moment to collect her thoughts and said aloud, "Oh no... Josh what did you do." Lindsey then turned to Amanda and looked at her dead in the eyes, "I think Josh put these pills in the drinks. Everyone who drank something has been trapped in a quantum realm. We are invisible." 
    <br><br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amanda, her brother, and his friends began to panic, "What do we do?" they kept asking. 
    <br><br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There's nothing we can do," Lindsey replied. They all watched as the cops walked over to the pantry door to find Josh laying on the ground, his eyes completely white and blood dripping down his hands. 
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amanda's brother, Matthew, spotted a little red pill on the ground next to Josh - barely visible. He pointed it out to Amanda and his friends, but they couldn't see it. Matthew started to walk over to pick up the pill. As soon as he took his first step, the police officer shouted at him "What do you think you're doing?". 
    <br><br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Matthew said back, "There's a red pill next to Josh, it must be the same one as what he put in everyone's drinks". The police officer picked it up and found more in Josh's pocket. They all stood in silence trying to examine what this realm-altering pill is. 
    <br><br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How can he see you Matt?" Amanda asked. 
    <br><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't drink, Mand" he replied.
    <br><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After looking at it for awhile and discussing what they should do, they all decided to each take a pill to enter the same quantum realm the party is trapped in and try to bring everyone back. Amanda, Matthew, Lindsey and Trevor all took a pill and closed their eyes. After what felt like the most painful headache ever, which they thought must explain the scream they heard, they opened their eyes and immediatley were back in what appeared to be the exact same spot, but everyone who was at the party was also there. They couldn't wrap their mind around what realm they were in, since everything and everyone appeared the exact same. They decided to just live forever in this realm and they danced the rest of the night away.</p>
